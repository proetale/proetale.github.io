I am a mathematics student in UK. I still do not know what
sort of math interests me.

Last year I did a UROP and figured out the foundations of algebraic geometry 
and did most of the problems in Hartshorne. You cannot
find my writeup for this because I never put it online.

This year I will probably do a UROP on more geometry, probably related to
representation theory. More on that to come.

Mathematical things I like include stacks, some subset of representation
theory, and some arithmetic problems.
