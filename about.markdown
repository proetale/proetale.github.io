I am a mathematics student at Imperial College London. I still do not know what
sort of math interests me.

Last year I did a UROP and learnt about the Riemann-Roch theorem. You cannot
find my writeup for this because I never put it online.

This year I will probably do a UROP on D-modules. More on that to come.

Mathematical things I like include stacks, some subset of representation
theory, and arithmetic questions (only the questions).
